**Key Priorities:**

**Day 1-3:**
Focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts like syntax, DOM manipulation, objects, and arrays. These will be essential for dynamic UI interactions.

**Day 4:**
Grasp asynchronous JavaScript with callbacks, promises, and async/await, as these are critical for handling API calls and dynamic data loading.

**Day 5-6:**
Learn modern JavaScript features (ES6+), and spend time on debugging and error handling to ensure your code is efficient and error-free.

**Day 7:**
Apply your knowledge by building a small project, combining everything youâ€™ve learned throughout the week.
